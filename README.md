LangExtract is a new open-source Python library introduced by Google. It's a Gemini-powered information extraction library, designed to programmatically extract user-required information while ensuring the outputs are structured and grounded to the source content. The library offers a seamless way to extract structured information from unstructured textual data using LLMs with source grounding and interactive visualisation.
